1. Given an array arr[] of positive integers. Your task is to sort them so that the first part of the array contains odd numbers sorted in descending order, and the rest of the portion contains even numbers sorted in ascending order.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 10]
Output: [7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 10]
Explanation: 7 5 3 1 are odds in descending order and 2 4 10 are evens in ascending order.
Input: arr[] = [0, 4, 5, 3, 7, 2, 1]

5. Using recursion find the inversion of count
You are working for an e-commerce company that deals with a large volume of customer orders. The company wants to optimize its warehouse operations by analyzing the efficiency of order processing.
The goal is to count the number of inversion pairs in the order processing times to identify potential inefficiencies. An inversion pair in this context is defined as a situation where a later order (in terms of processing sequence) took less time to process than an earlier order. By identifying these inversions, you can pinpoint areas where the warehouse team may need to improve their workflow or processes.
Input
An array P[] of n integers representing the processing times of orders, in the order they were processed.
Output
The count of inversion pairs in the array.

Example
Input:
P[] = [30, 45, 25, 60, 20]
Output:
The inversion count is 6
Explanation: There are 5 inversion pairs in the array:
(45, 25) where 45 > 25 and 
(45, 20) where 45 > 20 and 
(30, 25) where 30 > 25 and 
(30, 20) where 30 > 20 and 
(60, 20) where 60 > 20 and 
(25, 20) where 25 > 20 and 



6. Given two strings A and B, find if A is a subsequence of B.
Example 1:
Input:
A = TCS
B = Tata Service
Output: 0
Explanation: A is not a subsequence of B
as 'C' appears after 'S'

Example 2:
Input:
A = sdm
B = sridharmashthlamanjunath
Output: 1
Explanation: A is a subsequence of B.

Example 3:
Input:
A = sdmit
B = sridharmashthlainstitute
Output: 0
Explanation: A is not a subsequence of B.


7. Minimum Moves to Convert String
You are given a string s consisting of n characters which are either 'X' or 'O'.
A move is defined as selecting three consecutive characters of s and converting them to 'O'. Note that if a move is applied to the character 'O', it will stay the same.
Return the minimum number of moves required so that all the characters of s are converted to 'O'.
Example 1:
Input: s = "XXX"
Output: 1
Explanation: XXX -> OOO
We select all the 3 characters and convert them in one move.
Example 2:
Input: s = "XXOX"
Output: 2
Explanation: XXOX -> OOOX -> OOOO
We select the first 3 characters in the first move, and convert them to 'O'.
Then we select the last 3 characters and convert them so that the final string contains all 'O's.
Example 3:
Input: s = "OOOO"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no 'X's in s to convert.


Practice:
1. Prefix and post fix sum of list using recursion
Input:
23,12,98,45,18,45,12,98
Output:
Prefix Sum:
98, 110, 155, 173, 218, 316, 328, 351
Postfix Sum:
23, 35, 133, 178, 196, 241, 253, 351

2. Consider the following array is account balance of last 7 transactions, find the period of time (subSum) where the max amount kept in the account.
(max sub array where sum is max)
eg:
Input: 2, -4, 1, 9, -6, 7, -3
output: 11
Input: 2, -4, 1, 9, -6, -3
Output: 10
