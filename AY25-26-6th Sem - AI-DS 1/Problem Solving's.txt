Given an array arr[] of positive integers. Your task is to sort them so that the first part of the array contains odd numbers sorted in descending order, and the rest of the portion contains even numbers sorted in ascending order.
Examples:
Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 5, 4, 7, 10]
Output: [7, 5, 3, 1, 2, 4, 10]
Explanation: 7 5 3 1 are odds in descending order and 2 4 10 are evens in ascending order.
Input: arr[] = [0, 4, 5, 3, 7, 2, 1]
Output: [7, 5, 3, 1, 0, 2, 4]
Explanation: 7 5 3 1 are odds in descending order and 0 2 4 are evens in ascending order.

Given two strings A and B, find if A is a subsequence of B.
Example 1:
Input:
A = AXY 
B = YADXCP
Output: 0 
Explanation: A is not a subsequence of B
as 'Y' appears before 'A'.

Example 2:
Input:
A = sdm
B = sridharmashthlamanjunath
Output: 1
Explanation: A is a subsequence of B.

Example 3:
Input:
A = sdmit
B = sridharmashthlainstitute
Output: 0
Explanation: A is not a subsequence of B.

Input:
2, -4, 1, 9, -6, 7, -3
output:
10

Input:
-2, 1, 3, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4
Output:
7

Minimum Moves to Convert String
You are given a string s consisting of n characters which are either 'X' or 'O'.
A move is defined as selecting three consecutive characters of s and converting them to 'O'. Note that if a move is applied to the character 'O', it will stay the same.
Return the minimum number of moves required so that all the characters of s are converted to 'O'.
Example 1:
Input: s = "XXX"
Output: 1
Explanation: XXX -> OOO
We select all the 3 characters and convert them in one move.
Example 2:
Input: s = "XXOX"
Output: 2
Explanation: XXOX -> OOOX -> OOOO
We select the first 3 characters in the first move, and convert them to 'O'.
Then we select the last 3 characters and convert them so that the final string contains all 'O's.
Example 3:
Input: s = "OOOO"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no 'X's in s to convert.
