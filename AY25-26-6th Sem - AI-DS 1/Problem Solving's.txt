5. Using recursion find the inversion of count
You are working for an e-commerce company that deals with a large volume of customer orders. The company wants to optimize its warehouse operations by analyzing the efficiency of order processing.
The goal is to count the number of inversion pairs in the order processing times to identify potential inefficiencies. An inversion pair in this context is defined as a situation where a later order (in terms of processing sequence) took less time to process than an earlier order. By identifying these inversions, you can pinpoint areas where the warehouse team may need to improve their workflow or processes.
Input
An array P[] of n integers representing the processing times of orders, in the order they were processed.
Output
The count of inversion pairs in the array.

Example
Input:
P[] = [30, 45, 25, 60, 20]
Output:
The inversion count is 6
Explanation: There are 5 inversion pairs in the array:
(45, 25) where 45 > 25 and 
(45, 20) where 45 > 20 and 
(30, 25) where 30 > 25 and 
(30, 20) where 30 > 20 and 
(60, 20) where 60 > 20 and 
(25, 20) where 25 > 20 and

7. Minimum Moves to Convert String
You are given a string s consisting of n characters which are either 'X' or 'O'.
A move is defined as selecting three consecutive characters of s and converting them to 'O'. Note that if a move is applied to the character 'O', it will stay the same.
Return the minimum number of moves required so that all the characters of s are converted to 'O'.
Example 1:
Input: s = "XXX"
Output: 1
Explanation: XXX -> OOO
We select all the 3 characters and convert them in one move.
Example 2:
Input: s = "XXOX"
Output: 2
Explanation: XXOX -> OOOX -> OOOO
We select the first 3 characters in the first move, and convert them to 'O'.
Then we select the last 3 characters and convert them so that the final string contains all 'O's.
Example 3:
Input: s = "OOOO"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no 'X's in s to convert.

1. Twisted prime
Note: A number is called Twisted Prime if it is a prime and its reverse is also a prime.
Example 1:
Input: N = 97
Output: 1

reverse 79 is also a prime number. Thus 
97 is a  twisted Prime and so, the answer is 1.
Example 2:
Input: N = 43
Output: 0
Explanation: 43 is a prime number but its 
reverse 34 is not a prime.So, 43 is not a 
twisted prime and thus, answer is 0.

3. Mahesh and Suresh are playing a new game “Checkers“. This is a very simple game but becomes challenging when more expert players are playing. Below is the description of the game and rules: The game is played by 2 players. This game consists of an N*M matrix. Each of the cells is background lit by lights. And these cells are either Green or Black. The green and black cells are randomly lit and will be represented with 1’s and 0’s respectively. Green cells are the cells that need to be captured. Black cells cannot be captured. Everyone is in the race to capture the maximum number of cells possible.
In a single chance, a player can capture all those adjacent cells which share an edge. Once there is no adjacent edge the chance breaks and the next player will play.
Mahesh always starts the game and checks down and right and Suresh is second checks up and left.Both players are playing optimally, find out how many cells Suresh captures.

4. Imagine you are a software engineer working on a document editing application. The application allows users to edit and correct typos in their documents. One of the features you are developing is a tool to calculate the minimum number of operations required to transform one word into another. This feature is crucial for suggesting the most efficient edits and corrections to the users.
Task: Given two words, implement a function that calculates the minimum number of operations required to convert the first word into the second word. The allowed operations are:
Insert a character
Delete a character
Replace a character

1. Valid Palindrome, A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.
Given a string s, return true if it is a palindrome, or false otherwise.

Example 1:
Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true
Explanation: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.

Example 2:
Input: s = "race a car"
Output: false
Explanation: "raceacar" is not a palindrome.

Example 3:
Input: s = " "
Output: true
Explanation: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters.
Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.



2. Two Sum II - Input Array Is Sorted
Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length.

Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

Your solution must use only constant extra space.
Example 1:
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore, index1 = 1, index2 = 2. 
We return [1, 2].

Example 2:
Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 4 is 6. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 3. 
We return [1, 3].

Example 3:
Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of -1 and 0 is -1. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2. 
We return [1, 2].
