5. Using recursion find the inversion of count
You are working for an e-commerce company that deals with a large volume of customer orders. The company wants to optimize its warehouse operations by analyzing the efficiency of order processing.
The goal is to count the number of inversion pairs in the order processing times to identify potential inefficiencies. An inversion pair in this context is defined as a situation where a later order (in terms of processing sequence) took less time to process than an earlier order. By identifying these inversions, you can pinpoint areas where the warehouse team may need to improve their workflow or processes.
Input
An array P[] of n integers representing the processing times of orders, in the order they were processed.
Output
The count of inversion pairs in the array.

Example
Input:
P[] = [30, 45, 25, 60, 20]
Output:
The inversion count is 6
Explanation: There are 5 inversion pairs in the array:
(45, 25) where 45 > 25 and 
(45, 20) where 45 > 20 and 
(30, 25) where 30 > 25 and 
(30, 20) where 30 > 20 and 
(60, 20) where 60 > 20 and 
(25, 20) where 25 > 20 and 



6. Given two strings A and B, find if A is a subsequence of B.

B = sridharmashthlamanjunath
Output: 1
Explanation: A is a subsequence of B.

Example 3:
Input:
A = sdmit
B = sridharmashthlainstitute
Output: 0
Explanation: A is not a subsequence of B.


7. Minimum Moves to Convert String
You are given a string s consisting of n characters which are either 'X' or 'O'.
A move is defined as selecting three consecutive characters of s and converting them to 'O'. Note that if a move is applied to the character 'O', it will stay the same.
Return the minimum number of moves required so that all the characters of s are converted to 'O'.
Example 1:
Input: s = "XXX"
Output: 1
Explanation: XXX -> OOO
We select all the 3 characters and convert them in one move.
Example 2:
Input: s = "XXOX"
Output: 2
Explanation: XXOX -> OOOX -> OOOO
We select the first 3 characters in the first move, and convert them to 'O'.
Then we select the last 3 characters and convert them so that the final string contains all 'O's.
Example 3:
Input: s = "OOOO"
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no 'X's in s to convert.

1. Twisted prime
Note: A number is called Twisted Prime if it is a prime and its reverse is also a prime.
Example 1:
Input: N = 97
Output: 1
Explanation: 97 is a prime number. Its 
reverse 79 is also a prime number. Thus 
97 is a  twisted Prime and so, the answer is 1.
Example 2:
Input: N = 43
Output: 0
Explanation: 43 is a prime number but its 
reverse 34 is not a prime.So, 43 is not a 
twisted prime and thus, answer is 0.

2. Find the least prime number within the boundary that can be added with first array element that makes them divisible by second array elements at respective index
Input:
int[] arr1 = {3, 5, 7};
int[] arr2 = {10, 15, 20};
Output:
7 -1 13 
Input:
int[] arr1 = {4, 6, 8};
int[] arr2 = {5, 10, 15};
Output:
-1 -1 -1

Input: s = "5555..555"
Output: false
Explanation: "5555..555" is not a valid. IPv4 address, as the middle two portions are missing.
Input: s = "0.0.0.0255"
Output: false

4. This is one of the most popular coding problems which can be solved using the Dynamic Programming technique. In this problem, you are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. The question is, in how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

Example 1:
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Example 2:
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step.

Example 3:
Input: 5
Output: 8

2. You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k.
You are initially standing at index 0. In one move, you can jump at most k steps forward without going outside the boundaries of the array. That is, you can jump from index i to any index in the range [i + 1, min(n - 1, i + k)] inclusive.
You want to reach the last index of the array (index n - 1). Your score is the sum of all nums[j] for each index j you visited in the array.
Return the maximum score you can get.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,-1,-2,4,-7,3], k = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: You can choose your jumps forming the subsequence [1,-1,4,3] (underlined above). The sum is 7.
