Day 1:

A store offers the following discount policy based on the total purchase amount:
If the total purchase is greater than ₹5000, the customer gets a 20% discount.
If the total purchase is greater than or equal to ₹3000 and less than or equal to ₹5000, the customer gets a 10% discount.
Otherwise, there is no discount.
Output:
Sample Input1: 
Enter total purchase amount: 6200
Sample output1: 
Discount amount: Rs.1240.0
Final amount to pay: Rs.4960.0

Solution:

int main() {
    float purchaseAmount, discount, finalAmount;
    cout << "Enter total purchase amount: ";
    cin >> purchaseAmount;
    if (purchaseAmount > 5000) {
        discount = purchaseAmount * 0.20;
    } else if (purchaseAmount >= 3000) {
        discount = purchaseAmount * 0.10;
    } else {
	cout << "No discount applicable."
	discount=0.0;
}
    finalAmount = purchaseAmount - discount;
    if (discount > 0){
        cout << "Discount amount: ₹" << discount << endl;
    }
    cout << "Final amount to pay: ₹" << finalAmount << endl;

2. A school software needs to validate characters entered by students.
Write a program to check if a character is:
An uppercase letter (A-Z)
A lowercase letter (a-z)
Not a letter (e.g., digits or symbols)
Output:
Sample Input1: 
Enter a character: G
Sample output1: 
G is an uppercase letter

Solution:

int main() {
    char ch;
    cout << "Enter a character: ";
    cin >> ch;
    if (ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z') {
        cout << ch << " is an uppercase letter." << endl;
    } else if (ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z') {
        cout << ch << " is a lowercase letter." << endl;
    } else {
        cout << ch << " is not a letter." << endl;
    }

3. Electricity Billing System
--------------------------
1. Residential (₹3/unit)
2. Commercial (₹5/unit)
3. Industrial (₹8/unit)
Input:
Enter customer type (1-3): 1
Enter units consumed: 150
Output:
Customer Type: Residential
Rate per unit: Rs.3
Total Bill: Rs.450

Solution:

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main() {
    int customerType;
    float units, rate, total;
    cout << "Electricity Billing System\n";
    cout << "--------------------------\n";
    cout << "1. Residential (₹3/unit)\n";
    cout << "2. Commercial (₹5/unit)\n";
    cout << "3. Industrial (₹8/unit)\n";
    cout << "Enter customer type (1-3): ";
    cin >> customerType;
    cout << "Enter units consumed: ";
    cin >> units;
    switch (customerType) {
        case 1:
            rate = 3.0;
            total = units * rate;
            cout << "Customer Type: Residential\n";
            cout << "Rate per unit: ₹" << rate << endl;
            cout << "Total Bill: ₹" << total << endl;
            break;
        case 2:
            rate = 5.0;
            total = units * rate;
            cout << "Customer Type: Commercial\n";
            cout << "Rate per unit: ₹" << rate << endl;
            cout << "Total Bill: ₹" << total << endl;
            break;
        case 3:
            rate = 8.0;
            total = units * rate;
            cout << "Customer Type: Industrial\n";
            cout << "Rate per unit: ₹" << rate << endl;
            cout << "Total Bill: ₹" << total << endl;
            break;
        default:
            cout << "Invalid customer type. Please enter 1, 2, or 3.\n";
    }
    return 0;
}

4. Create a program that takes a month number (1 to 12) as input and prints the number of days in that month using a switch-case. Handle invalid inputs gracefully.
Month-Day Rules:
31 days → January, March, May, July, August, October, December → (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12)
30 days → April, June, September, November → (4, 6, 9, 11)
28 or 29 days → February → (2)

Solution:

int main() {
    int month;
    cout << "Enter month number (1-12): ";
    cin >> month;
    switch (month) {
        case 1: case 3: case 5: case 7: case 8: case 10: case 12:
            cout << "This month has 31 days." << endl;
            break;
        case 4: case 6: case 9: case 11:
            cout << "This month has 30 days." << endl;
            break;
case 2:
            cout << "This month has 28 or 29 days (leap year dependent)." << endl;
            break;
  default:
            cout << "Invalid month number. Please enter a value between 1 and 12." << endl;
    }
    return 0; }      

5. Character toggle

A school software needs to validate characters entered by students.
Write a program to check if a character is:
An uppercase letter (A-Z)
A lowercase letter (a-z)
Not a letter (e.g., digits or symbols)
Output:
Sample Input1: 
Enter a character: G
Sample output1: 
G is an uppercase letter

Solution:

int main() {
    char ch;
    cout << "Enter a character: ";
    cin >> ch;
    if (ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z') {
        cout << ch << " is an uppercase letter." << endl;
    } else if (ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z') {
        cout << (char)(ch+32);
    } else {
        cout << (char)(ch+32);
    }
